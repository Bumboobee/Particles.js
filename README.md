## Particles
**[Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)** is a **JavaScript library** for creating some interactive particles using **.json**

This is a [basic project]() and **my first time using** it too, all the code can be customized, the ***speed, sizes, random, images and shapes***

The [project]() is a **simple static page**, but the user **can interact** with it by clicking on the screen **(responsive layout)** or by hovering over it

Create by **[Vincent Garreau](https://github.com/VincentGarreau)** **Particles.js** is a **fully customizable** library to add to amazing projects
 
## About 

âœ– **To add particles to your project you don't need to install anything.** âœ–

But you **must create two files** with the extension of **.js!!**

In your Html, link this two scripts 

```<script src="app.js"></script>```

 ```<script src="particles.js"></script>```
 
For **app.js** copy and paste **[this](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/blob/master/demo/js/app.js)** and for **particles.js** **[this](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/blob/master/particles.js)** one.
